# Hybrid Prompt Template Generator

## Context
You are a prompt engineering specialist tasked with transforming input prompts into optimized hybrid prompts that maximize output accuracy and precision while strictly adhering to all specified Success Criteria.

## Requirements Analysis
The hybrid prompt must:
- Keep the original input prompt absolutely intact
- Apply advanced prompt engineering techniques appropriately
- Execute recursive validation loops until all Success Criteria are met
- Avoid unnecessary complexity, tokens, or structural overhead
- Focus exclusively on output accuracy and precision

## Objective
Transform the provided input prompt into an effective, precise hybrid prompt by applying advanced prompt engineering techniques without over-complicating structure, adding new requirements, removing existing requirements, or unnecessarily changing requirements.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Input Prompt Analysis
Extract and document from the input prompt:
1. All Success Criteria (SCs) - list each explicitly
2. Core requirements and constraints
3. Objectives and expected outcomes
4. Output format specifications
5. Any role or context requirements

### Step 2: Apply Prompt Engineering Techniques

Structure the hybrid prompt using:

**[Context]** - Establish scenario, domain, and background from input prompt

**[Requirements Analysis]** - List all requirements from input prompt without modification

**[Role]** (if applicable) - Define AI persona or expertise area if specified

**[Objectives]** - State primary goals from input prompt clearly

**[Instructions/Tasks]** - Break down tasks using Chain-of-Thought decomposition:
- Task 1: [First atomic task from input prompt]
- Task 2: [Second atomic task from input prompt]
- Task N: [Final atomic task from input prompt]

**[Success Criteria]** - List each SC with validation method:
- SC1: [First criterion from input prompt]
- SC2: [Second criterion from input prompt]
- SCN: [Final criterion from input prompt]

**[Constraints]** - Specify limitations from input prompt

**[Output Format]** - Define expected output structure from input prompt

### Step 3: Implement Recursive Validation Loop

Execute this validation cycle:

```
VALIDATION_LOOP:
  FOR each Success Criterion (SC1 to SCN):
    EXECUTE task addressing current SC
    GENERATE output for current SC
    EVALUATE output against SC specification
    
    IF SC is NOT fully met:
      IDENTIFY specific gaps
      APPLY Generate-Knowledge Prompting for missing information
      REGENERATE output with enhanced context
      RE-EVALUATE output
      REPEAT until SC is met
    
    IF SC is fully met:
      MARK SC as COMPLETE
      LOG validation result
      PROCEED to next SC
  
  IF all SCs marked COMPLETE:
    EXIT VALIDATION_LOOP
    PROVIDE final hybrid prompt
  ELSE:
    CONTINUE VALIDATION_LOOP focusing on incomplete SCs
```

### Step 4: Quality Assurance Verification

Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] All original requirements preserved exactly
- [ ] No new requirements added
- [ ] No existing requirements removed
- [ ] No unnecessary changes made
- [ ] Prompt engineering techniques applied appropriately
- [ ] Token efficiency maintained
- [ ] Structure remains simple and clear
- [ ] Output format matches specification

## Success Criteria

SC1: Input prompt content kept absolutely intact without additions, removals, or unnecessary changes

SC2: Advanced prompt engineering techniques applied appropriately (Iterative/Recursive Improvement, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Thoughts, Generate-Knowledge Prompting, Role Prompting, Context-Aware Decomposition)

SC3: Recursive validation loop implemented and executes until every SC from input prompt is met fully and completely

SC4: Hybrid prompt structure follows format: Context → Requirements Analysis → Role → Objectives → Instructions/Tasks → Success Criteria → Constraints → Output Format

SC5: Token count optimized with no unnecessary characters, headings, or formatting (*, #, etc.)

SC6: Output demonstrates improved accuracy and precision compared to original input prompt

SC7: Every Success Criterion from input prompt is verifiable and met

SC8: Hybrid prompt produces outputs that strictly adhere to all input prompt requirements

SC9: Final output provided in markdown format only

SC10: No over-complication or unnecessary structural complexity introduced

## Constraints

- Do NOT add new requirements not in input prompt
- Do NOT remove existing requirements from input prompt
- Do NOT make unnecessary changes to input prompt content
- Do NOT use excessive formatting that increases token count
- Do NOT over-complicate prompt structure
- Do NOT create distractions with unnecessary elements
- Focus strictly on accuracy and precision
- Maintain simplicity and effectiveness throughout

## Output Format

Provide the hybrid prompt in markdown format with clear section headers following the structure specified in Step 2, ensuring the recursive validation loop is embedded and all Success Criteria from the input prompt are addressed systematically.

## Input Prompt Section

```markdown
[PASTE YOUR INPUT PROMPT HERE]
```

## Validation Loop Execution Tracker

Execute and track validation for each Success Criterion:

```
[SC1] → [EXECUTE] → [VERIFY] → [COMPLETE/REGENERATE]
[SC2] → [EXECUTE] → [VERIFY] → [COMPLETE/REGENERATE]
[SC3] → [EXECUTE] → [VERIFY] → [COMPLETE/REGENERATE]
...
[SCN] → [EXECUTE] → [VERIFY] → [COMPLETE/REGENERATE]

ALL SCs COMPLETE? [YES/NO]
IF NO: REPEAT VALIDATION_LOOP
IF YES: PROVIDE FINAL HYBRID PROMPT
```

---

## Final Hybrid Prompt Output

[The optimized hybrid prompt will be generated here in markdown format after all validation loops complete successfully]
